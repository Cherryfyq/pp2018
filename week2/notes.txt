Lecture #Week 2 by Raman Buzaubakov

Questions from last lecture:
 - What is a Programming?
 - What do we need for programming?
 - What is a syntax?
 - What is a compiler?
 - What is a command line interface?
 - What does #include do?
 - How to read input from CLI?
 - How to output something to CLI?
 
 
Missed examples from last week:
 - size of each data type
 - bool data type
 - printf - function
 - execution priority of arithmetical operations (Operator Precedence[1])
 - mod division [2]

This week:
 - bit manipulation, or, xor, and, >>, << [4]
	- the identity of information is bit (0 or 1)
	- unary operators: or, and, xor, not, shift left, shift right
 
 - if else operator [5]
	- converts the statement into bool type
	- if and only if condition of if statment is true only in this case it executes if body block
	- multiple if statments vs if-else statements
	-examples
	
 - loop operators: for, while, do while [6, 7]
	- for loop
	- while loop
	- do while loop
	- examples
